## Question 1)
```{r}
library(RSQLite)
library(DBI)
con <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = "classic.db")

```

### (a)
Primary Key: productCode, orderNumber 

Foreign Key: p.productCode, od.orderNumber

### (b)
```{sql 1b, connection = con}
SELECT productLine, SUM(quantityOrdered) AS totalQuantityOrdered
FROM orderdetails
JOIN products ON orderdetails.productCode = products.productCode
GROUP BY productLine
ORDER BY totalQuantityOrdered DESC

```
Classic Cars has the most quantity ordered

### (c)
```{sql 1c1, connection = con}
SELECT orderNumber, SUM(quantityOrdered) AS totalQuantityOrdered
FROM orderdetails
GROUP BY orderNumber
ORDER BY totalQuantityOrdered DESC
LIMIT 1;

```
```{sql 1c2, connection = con}
SELECT od.orderNumber, p.productName, od.quantityOrdered
FROM orderDetails od
JOIN products p ON od.productCode = p.productCode
WHERE od.orderNumber = (
    SELECT orderNumber
    FROM orderdetails
    GROUP BY orderNumber
    ORDER BY SUM(quantityOrdered) DESC
    LIMIT 1)
ORDER BY od.quantityOrdered DESC;

```
### (d)
```{sql 1d, connection = con}
SELECT 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN od.priceEach < p.MSRP THEN 1 END) AS below_msrp,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN od.priceEach = p.MSRP THEN 1 END) AS at_msrp,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN od.priceEach > p.MSRP THEN 1 END) AS above_msrp
FROM orderDetails od
JOIN products p ON od.productCode = p.productCode

```

### (e)
```{sql 1e1, connection = con}
SELECT COUNT(p.productCode) AS never_purchased
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN orderDetails od ON p.productCode = od.productCode
WHERE od.orderNumber is NULL;

```
```{sql 1e2, connection = con}
SELECT p.productCode, p.productName
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN orderDetails od ON p.productCode = od.productCode
WHERE od.orderNumber is NULL;

```

## Question 2)

### (a)
```{sql 2a1, connection = con}
SELECT orderNumber, COUNT(DISTINCT productCode) AS distinctProducts
FROM orderDetails
GROUP BY orderNumber
ORDER BY distinctProducts DESC
LIMIT 1;

```

```{sql 2a2, connection = con}
SELECT p.productName
FROM orderDetails od
JOIN products p ON od.productCode = p.productCode
WHERE od.orderNumber = (
  SELECT orderNumber
  FROM orderDetails
  GROUP BY orderNumber
  ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT productCode) DESC
  LIMIT 1
)
ORDER BY p.productName;
```

### (b)
```{sql 2b, connection = con}
SELECT c.contactFirstName, c.contactLastName, c.country
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customerNumber = o.customerNumber
WHERE o.orderNumber = (
  SELECT orderNumber
  FROM orderDetails
  GROUP BY orderNumber
  ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT productCode) DESC
  LIMIT 1
);

```

### (c)
```{sql 2c, connection = con}
SELECT c.customerName, c.contactFirstName, c.contactLastName, o.orderNumber, 
SUM(od.quantityOrdered * od.priceEach) AS total
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customerNumber = o.customerNumber
JOIN orderDetails od ON o.orderNumber = od.orderNumber
GROUP BY o.orderNumber, c.customerNumber, c.customerName, c.contactFirstName, c.contactLastName
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 1;

```

### (d)
```{sql 2d1, connection = con}
SELECT p.productName, SUM(od.quantityOrdered) AS totalQuantity
FROM products p
JOIN orderDetails od ON p.productCode = od.productCode
JOIN orders o ON od.orderNumber = o.orderNumber
JOIN customers c ON o.customerNumber = c.customerNumber
WHERE c.country = 'USA'
GROUP BY p.productCode, p.productName
ORDER BY totalQuantity DESC
LIMIT 1;

```
```{sql 2d2, connection = con}
SELECT p.productName, SUM(od.quantityOrdered) AS totalQuantity
FROM products p
JOIN orderDetails od ON p.productCode = od.productCode
JOIN orders o ON od.orderNumber = o.orderNumber
JOIN customers c ON o.customerNumber = c.customerNumber
WHERE c.country = 'Germany'
GROUP BY p.productCode, p.productName
ORDER BY totalQuantity DESC
LIMIT 1; 

```

## Question 3)

### (a)
Left join is intended to return all orders that is related to the customers information
Inner join is intended to return only orders that have matching customers
Right join is intended to return all customers that is related to the order information

### (b)
```{sql 3b, connection = con}
SELECT COUNT(*) AS orderCount
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customerNumber = c.customerNumber
WHERE c.contactFirstName = 'Susan'
AND c.contactLastName = 'Nelson'

```

### (c)
```{sql 3c, connection = con}
SELECT COUNT(od.quantityOrdered) AS totalQauntityOrdered
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customerNumber = o.customerNumber
JOIN orderDetails od ON o.orderNumber = od.orderNumber
WHERE c.contactFirstName = 'Susan'
AND c.contactLastName = 'Nelson'

```


## Question 4)
```{sql 4, connection = con}
SELECT salesRepEmployeeNumber, COUNT(DISTINCT customerNumber) AS totalCustomers,
SUM(totalSpending) AS totalCustomerSpending
FROM (
  SELECT c.salesRepEmployeeNumber, c.customerNumber, 
  SUM(od.quantityOrdered * od.priceEach) AS totalSpending
  FROM orderDetails od
  JOIN orders o ON od.orderNumber = o.orderNumber
  JOIN customers c ON o.customerNumber = c.customerNumber
  WHERE c.salesRepEmployeeNumber IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY c.salesRepEmployeeNumber, c.customerNumber
) AS customerSpending
GROUP BY salesRepEmployeeNumber
ORDER BY totalCustomerSpending DESC;
